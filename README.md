# Covid Helper(?)
### Finding resources for the most vulnerable during the Covid pandemic

Most of us will never imagine the struggles that out most vulnerable go through everyday, wondering where their next meal will come from, where they will sleep for the night. In the middle of a pandemic, another wrinkle is thrown as well: where can they go for help?

Covid Helper (name subject to change) allows the homeless or the less fourtunate to have all covid related information, at the tip of their fingers.
