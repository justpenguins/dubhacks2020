# Covid Resource Maps
### Finding resources for the most vulnerable during the Covid pandemic

Most of us will never imagine the struggles that out most vulnerable go through everyday, wondering where their next meal will come from, where they will sleep for the night. In the middle of a pandemic, another wrinkle is thrown as well: where can they go for help?

Covid Helper allows the homeless or the less fourtunate to have all covid related information, at the tip of their fingers. We understand that it's weird that a application is built for the homeless, but this web app is aimed at those who have access to the internet through social welfare centres.

Sample Covid information would include mask handout locations and dates, vacciniation sites, food banks, and COVID testing sites.
